[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) provide a simple way to make a
website using
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and
[git](https://git-scm.com).

For me, the painful aspects of making a website are

- Working with html and css
- Finding a hosting site
- Transferring stuff to the hosting site

With [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), you just write things in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
[GitHub](https://github.com) hosts the site for you, and you just push
material to your GitHub repository with `git add`, `git commit`, and
`git push`.

The source for this minimal tutorial is [on github](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site).
