---

I am currently working at the [Center for Information and Bubble Studies](https://bubblestudies.ku.dk/) at the University of Copenhagen - Denmark. My multidisciplinary research and development projects can be broadly associated with the fields of computational social science and educational research. Our team and I are doing online experiments to investigate collective phenomena in social media, such as attitude change, decision-making and social illusions. We currently develop multiplayer online learning games for norm-based intervention studies in classrooms.

I received a BS in [theoretical chemistry](https://www.ku.dk/) in 1994, from the
University of Copenhagen, and a PhD in complex systems in 1998 from the
[Niels Bohr Institute](https://www.nbi.ku.dk); my PhD advisors were
[Axel Hunding](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2006150665_Axel_Hunding) and
[Kim Sneppen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=LIBL6nQAAAAJ).
I was a postdoctoral fellow with
[Kjeld Rasmussen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dR_89cEAAAAJ)
at the
[Department of Geoscience](https://ign.ku.dk/english/),
and with
[Vincent F. Hendricks](https://comm.ku.dk/staff/?pure=en/persons/30701)
at the
[Department of Communication](https://comm.ku.dk/).

Apart from my scientific work, I am/was a journalist and science writer at a number of Danish newspapers such as
[Information](https://www.information.dk/search/site/Robin%20Engelhardt),
[Weekendavisen](https://www.weekendavisen.dk/), and
[Ingeni√∏ren](https://ing.dk/sog/Robin%20Engelhardt). Apart from that, I've co-developed a number of games and learning games. Have a look at the games from the menu bar.
